This post will shed some light on the differences between arrays and pointers
specifically when it comes about referencing string literals. We will base 
our discussion on the following two programs:

alt='Array and pointer representation' width="376" height="192"/>

**array.c**

``` cpp
char a[] = "ROSEdu";
int main(void)
{
	a[0] = 'r';
	printf("%s\n", a);
	return 0;
}
```

**pointer.c**

``` cpp
char *p = "ROSEdu";
int main(void)
{
	*p = 'r';
	printf("%s\n", p);
	return 0;
}
```

Program `array.c`  defines an array of char whose elements are initialized
with character string literals, while `pointer.c` defines a pointer to char
and initializes it with the address of a memory area holding a string literal.

Notice array `a` and pointer `p` allocations in the image above. Can you make
a guess about size of `a` and size of `p`?

Next, both programs modify the first character of the string literal
`"ROSEdu"`.

Are these two programs equivalent? At the first glance the answer seems to be
positive, but let's have a minute and actually run the code.

    $ ./array
    rOSEdu

    $ ./pointer
    Segmentation fault

While we could modify array `a`, our program was killed attempting to modify
string literal pointed by `p`.

We will now have a look at the generated assembly code and notice the section
where string literal `"ROSEdu"` is stored.

alt='Array and pointer representation' width="298" height="283"/>

    $ gcc -S array.c -o array.s
    $ cat array.s
    .globl a
            .data
            .type  a, @object
            .size  a, 7
    a:
           .string "ROSEdu"

<!-- -->

    $ gcc -S pointer.c -o pointer.s
    $ cat pointer.s
    globl p
           .section        .rodata
    .LC0:
           .string "ROSEdu"
           .data
           .type  p, @object
           .size  p, 4
    p:
           .long  .LC0
           .text

We can see that array `a` is stored in *data* section, which is writable and
there is no problem when it is modified. On the other hand, we can notice that
`p` is a pointer stored in *data* section but it points to a *read only*
memory location, thus accessing it results in `Segmentation Fault`.


[C99 standards][1] ([Section 6.7.8][2]) states that:

*  contents of the array `a` is modifiable.
*  if an attempt is made to use pointer `p` to modify the contents of the
   array, the behaviour is undefined.

So now we see why `pointer.c` program crashed. `gcc` decided to store string
literal pointed by `p` into read only data section. One must remark that this
is not mandatory, and its implementation dependant.

We invite you to answer following questions:

*  What is the `sizeof(p)` and `sizeof(a)` in our previous examples?
*  What happens if variables `a` and `p` are declared on the stack?
*  Is it possible for the following expression `(const char []){"ROSEdu"} ==
   "ROSEdu"` to yield true?
