This blog started as an idea of Răzvan Deaconescu based on the fact that
several members of ROSEdu already had technical blogs (linked here on the
right) but they were not updated on a regular basis. Having a community blog
solves this problem and allows for a greater diversity among the topics
presented. Without further ado, this is it.

Excluding this article, the blog will contain technical articles, tips and
tricks, quick hacks to solve some problems and some articles explaining
different things related to IT.

Thanks go to: Alex Juncu (setting up the original Apache stuff), Răzvan
Deaconescu (coming up with this idea and setting up the initial repository),
Mihai Maruseac (configuration, layout, workflow both in the Jekyll version and
the Haskell one and content manager), Matei Oprea, Marius Ungureanu and Alex
Pălcuie (content managers).
