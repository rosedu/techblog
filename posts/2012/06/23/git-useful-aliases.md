This is the third article about [git][git] on this blog. It is highly recommended
to read the other two as well: there is [one][ggp] about some good practices
in using [git][git] and [another one][gsw] about some aliases which will speed
up your interaction with the commit history.

The series of articles about [git][git] continues with a short presentation
about two other aliases and the reason why they should be used in order to
create better commits.

### Rebase instead of merge

From time to time we rush to push our changes to the remote repository without
thinking of the possibility that another developer had made some commits in
the meantime. Luckily, we are announced when this happens:

    mihai@keldon:/data/ROSEdu/techblog$ git push
    To gitolite@git.rosedu.org:techblog.git
     ! [rejected]        contrib -> contrib (non-fast-forward)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'gitolite@git.rosedu.org:techblog.git'
    hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
    hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
    hint: before pushing again.
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

What is a fast-forward update? What we tried to do in the above command was
just to update one reference in the upstream repository: we wanted to change
the `HEAD` reference which pointed to a commit -- let's call it `A` -- to
another commit, the latest one in our repository -- let's call it `B`.

If and only if `B` is a descendant of `A` we have a fast-forward update.
Otherwise, the update is non-fast-forward. These definitions generalize to
local branches or any other kind of reference updates.

What is the purpose of this distinction? Any fast-forward updated guarantees
that the history of _both_ branches is not lost. In contrast, a
non-fast-forward update will certainly lose a part of the history.

We need to change our point of view to see this. Let us view the two
repositories in a simple diagram showing both branches from the very moment
when the local repository was cloned:

<img src="./images/git-useful-aliases/gua-1.png" alt="initial repo" style="max-width:400px;"/>

The `HEAD` reference for the remote repository was pointing at commit
`A` and we want to make it to point at commit `B` which is not a
direct descendent of `A`, thus the update is non-fast-forward.

If `git push` was allowed to finish successfully in any of the two cases then
the history from `O` up to `A` would be lost: developers would only see the
history from `O` to `B` and would work only on top of the `B` commit. This is
why `git push` failed.

The error message suggests to do a `git pull` in order to merge the two
branches. Let's see what will happen when we do this:

<img src="./images/git-useful-aliases/gua-2.png" alt="merge commit" style="max-width:400px;"/>

A merge commit `C` was created containing changes from both `A`
and `B`. This is a _new_ commit and it looks like the following one:

    mihai@keldon:$ git show 2603167
    commit 2603167229a11b8dad6715246041ad29f792308c
    Merge: ad4d7a1 6091ae3
    Author: Alex Juncu <ajuncu@ixiacom.com>
    Date:   Wed Nov 30 15:32:05 2011 +0200

        Merge branch 'contrib' of git.rosedu.org:techblog into contrib

There are cases where this merge commit is needed. However, not all instances
of the above diagram need a merge commit.

The other alternative is to do a rebase first using `git pull --rebase` for
example. In this case, the following thing will happen: a new commit `D` will
be created containing the set of changes needed to be applied on top of `A` in
order to reach `B`.

<img src="./images/git-useful-aliases/gua-3.png" alt="rebase commit" style="max-width:400px;"/>

Now, the `D` commit is already on top of `A` and the push will be a
fast-forward update. This can be seen from the following screen as well:

    mihai@keldon:$ git pull --rebase
    remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    remote: Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    From git.rosedu.org:techblog
       b557977..38da5d0  contrib    -> origin/contrib
    First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
    Applying: Add author for first article.

The push will simply update the `HEAD` reference to point to the `D` commit.

<img src="./images/git-useful-aliases/gua-4.png" alt="update HEAD after rebase commit" style="max-width:400px;"/>

If the rebase cannot be done because of a merge conflict we are announced of
this and the rebase will stop until we resolve it.

There are several ways to make [git][git] try to always use `--rebase` when
pulling. What I recommend is to create an alias. I have this in
`~/.gitconfig`:

    [alias]
            gpr = pull --rebase

This has two benefits: I always try to do a rebase first and I type less. In
fact, using TAB completion I have to press only 5 keys for this.

### Interactive addition of changes

One rule for better [git][git] commits is to have short and meaningful commits
with relevant commit messages. However, it is possible that we have done
several unrelated changes to a single file (for example we have updated a
comment and added some new code). Issuing a simple `git add file` will break
the above rule.

One solution for this is to use `git add --interactive`. It is better
to use `git add --patch` though.

Our change will be split in several hunks and each of them will be offered to
us with a simple question at the end:

    @@ -76,6 +78,10 @@ TODO
         Did you mean this?
                 gpr

    +TODO: git gdc

     [gsw]: http://techblog.rosedu.org/git-speeding-workflow.html "Git speeding workflow"
    Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,K,g,e,?]? y

We can decide to accept or reject the hunk for this commit or we can split it
in several other hunks. We can even edit the hunk if we need this.

In order to speed up typing I have an alias for this as well:

    gap = add --patch

I have imprinted in my muscle memory to never type `git add` but `git gap`.

### Conclusions

The two aliases presented above help us be a little more proficient with
[git][git] usage. I have been using them for several months now and the
results are good.
