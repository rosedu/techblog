This guide is designed to explain why you need to hide information and how can
you do this when you do not trust the channel through which messages are
conveyed. We will discuss about cryptographic system, encryption, decryption,
one-way function, asymmetric keys and more. You may think of cryptography as
the thing that keeps you untouchable inside of a soap bubble travelling by air
around the world.

Do you think it is safer by plane?

### Terminology

* *plaintext* or *cleartext* : intelligible message that sender wants to
transmit to a receiver

* *ciphertext* : unintelligible message resulted from *plaintext* encryption
using a [cryptosystem][cryptosys]

* *encryption* : the process of converting a *plaintext* into a *ciphertext*

* *decryption* : the process of converting a *ciphertext* into a *plaintext*
(reverse of *encryption*)

### Conventional cryptography

It is also called *symmetric-key* or *shared-key* encryption. The same key is
used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Consider this example as a conventional
cryptography:

> You and your roommate, both use the same key to lock/unlock the door of your
house. Thus, you share the same key to secure the room. It is true that your
roommate could have a copy of your key so he can join the room when you are at
work or vice-versa.

Example of conventional [cryptosystems][cryptosys] that use *symmetric-key*:
[Data Encryption Standard (DES)][des], [Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES)][aes]

Advantages: Fast.

Disadvantages: Not safe! The sender and receiver must agree upon a secret key
and prevent others from getting access to it. There is also a big problem if
they are not in the same physical location because of key distribution. How
could you give your home key to your roommate, which is in America while you
are in China?

Practical advice: Symmetric key should be changed with any message, so that
only one message can be leaked in case of disaster (crypt-analysed, stole,
etc).

### Key distribution

In the previous paragraph we were talking about [cryptosystems][cryptosys]
using *symmetric-keys* and the lack of an efficient method to securely share
your key with your roommate. Key distribution comes to help solving this
shortcoming. Next we are going to explain how key exchange becomes possible
over an untrusted communication channel.

#### Diffie-Hellman key exchange

This key exchange is based on an algorithm that mathematically cannot easily
compute [discrete logarithms][discretelog] of large numbers in a reasonable
amount of time. We will offer an overview of the algorithm using colours
before we run straightforward with numbers and abstract formula.

alt="Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange" width="300" height="450"/>

1. **Step 1**: Alice and Bob come to an agreement for a common colour.

1. **Step 2**: Alice choose her secret colour that will not tell to Bob. Bob
   will do the same thing.

1. **Step 3**: Alice will mix the common colour with the secret one and the
   result is a mixture. Bob will also mix his secret colour with the common
   one and will obtain a different mixture from Alice's one.

1. **Step 4**: Alice and Bob exchange the mixtures. This is the most critical
   step for communication because a [man-in-the-middle][mitm] could get access
   to those two mixtures. There is also a problem if the
   [man-in-the-middle][mitm] has both mixtures. Colour decomposition is
   irreversible. So the only chance to find two's secret colour is mixing all
   possible colours with the common colour from step one. Also, remember that
   a secret colour can be also a mixture of many other colours.

   **Update:** Diffie-Hellman does not protect you from a
   [man-in-the-middle][mitm] attack. To see why, imagine an attacker receiving
   all messages from Alice and replaying them back to Bob.

5. **Step 5**: Alice will add again her secret colour to the mixture that Bob
   sent to her. Bob will follow the same steps.

Finally Alice and Bob will obtain **a common** secret colour. Now, Alice and
Bob can safely exchange the symmetric-key we were talking in a previous
chapter, because they can encrypt and decrypt any message (sent through a
communication channel) using the above **secret colour**.

And here comes math. It is always about math when we do not have enough
colours.

**Step 1**: Alice and Bob come to an agreement for two large numbers: one
[prime][primenumber] `p` (recommended at least 512 bits) and a base `g` (a
[primitive root][primitiveroot] of `p`).

    p > 2
    g < p

**Step 2**: Alice chooses a secret integer `a`. Bob chooses a secret integer
`b`.

    a < p-1
    b < p-1

**Step 3**: Alice computes public value `x = g^a mod p`. Bob computes public
value `y = g^b mod p`, where `mod` is [modulo operator][modulo].

**Step 4**: Alice and Bob exchange `x` and `y`.

**Step 5**: Alice computes her secret key `k_a = y^a mod p`. Bob computes his
secret key `k_b = x^b mod p`. Mathematically it can be proved that `k_a =
k_b`. Alice and Bob now have a common secret key used for encryption and
decryption of any plaintext they exchange to safely communicate.

*Example:*

    p = 23, g = 5
    a = 6
    b = 15
    x = 5^6 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8 = x
    y = 5^15 mod 23 = 30517578125 mod 23 = 19 = y
    keys exchange:
    k_a = 19^6 mod 23 = 47045881 mod 23 = 2
    k_b = 8^15 mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23 = 2

If a [man-in-the-middle][mitm] knows both secret integers `a = 6` and `b = 15`
he could find the secret key used for communication. Here is how:

    k_a = k_b = g^(a*b) mod p = 5^90 mod 23 = 2

Advantages: Safe. Avoids [man-in-the-middle][mitm] attacks.

Disadvantages: You can not be sure of the actual identity of the real 'Bob'.

Diffie-Hellman can be also explained using [XOR (exclusive or)][xorop]
operator:

Suppose Alice wants to transmit the message `M = Hello` to Bob.
The binary representation of the message `M` is `B(M) =
0100100001100101011011000110110001101111`.
Alice encrypts the message with a secret key `K =
1010101000101110100101010001110010101010`.

    B(M) xor K =
    0100100001100101011011000110110001101111
    ^
    1010101000101110100101010001110010101010
    =
    1110001001001011111110010111000011000101 = L (encrypted M)

The equivalent message as plaintext for message `L` is `&#226;K&#249;p&#197;`.
Bob receives `&#226;K&#249;p&#197;` and use the same secret key `K` that he
has already exchanged with Alice to decrypt the message.

    L xor K =
    1110001001001011111110010111000011000101
    ^
    1010101000101110100101010001110010101010
    =
    0100100001100101011011000110110001101111 = M (original message)

Why it is this algorithm important? Because protocols like: [SSL][ssl],
[TSL][tsl], [SSH][ssh], [PKI][pki] or [IPSec][ipsec], all use Diffie-Hellman.

### Public key cryptography

Safe key distribution is resolved by *public-key* because it does not require
a secure initial key exchange between you and your roommate. This
[cryptosystem][cryptosys] is an *asymmetric-key* encryption -- in contrast to
*symmetric-key* -- that uses a pair of keys (two separate keys): a *public key*
for encoding and a *private key*, also called *secret key*, for decoding. The
*public-key* should not compromise the *private-key* even though both are
linked.

    public-key != private-key

We can compare the asymmetric-key [cryptosystem][cryptosys] with an e-mail
account. Your e-mail address is accessible to wide public (anyone can send
you an e-mail at your@email.com, for example) but you are the only one who has the
password to log in (that means only you can read the content of the e-mails).
The public-key is your e-mail address and the private-key is the password
linked with your e-mail address.

How it works:

**Step 1**: Create a pair of private-public keys (we will discuss later about
generating pairs of keys).

**Step 2**: Share your public key with your friends.

**Step 3**: Sender uses your public key to encrypt the plaintext (`original
message + encryption = ciphertext`).

**Step 4**: Sender sends you the ciphertext.

**Step 5**: Use your private key to decrypt the ciphertext (`ciphertext +
decryption = original message`).

Advantages: Convenience and security is increased.

Disadvantages: Slow encryption speed. All public-private keys are susceptible
to [brute-force attack][bruteforce] (this can be avoided by choosing large key
size). You can not verify partner's identity (vulnerable to impersonation).

**Usage**: Since large key size produces too large output of encrypted
message, encrypting and transmitting messages take longer. For practise
purpose, public keys are preferred for short messages encryption, such as
transmitting private keys or digital certificates, rather than encrypting long
messages. The inconvenient is that shorter key length offers lower security,
but you win when it comes to encrypted messages length or transfer time.
Because of that, keys should be frequently replaced with new ones.

### RSA

RSA named for Rivest, Shamir and Adleman, is the next implementation of public
key cryptosystem that use Diffie-Hellman method described in a previous
paragraph. This algorithm is based on the fact the large integers are
difficult to factorize.

I will explain RSA algorithm step by step not before I assume you love math :)

First of all you should have knowledge about [mod (modulo operation)][modulo]
and [coprime integers][coprime].

[Euler's theorem][eulerth]:

    x^phi(z) mod z = 1

where `phi(z)` is [Totient function][totient], `z` positive integer.

Briefly, Totient function counts the numbers of the coprimes to `z`.
If `z` is prime, then `phi(z) = z-1 (*)`.

Example:

    Consider z = 7
    1 relatively prime to 7
    2 relatively prime to 7
    3 relatively prime to 7
    4 relatively prime to 7
    5 relatively prime to 7
    6 relatively prime to 7
    => phi(z) = phi(7) = z-1 = 6

Let's continue with Euler's theorem:

    x^phi(z) mod z = 1 <-> exponentiate
    (x^phi(z) mod z) * (x^phi(z) mod z) = 1 * 1 <->
    x^(2*phi(z)) mod z = 1

Using [mathematical induction][mathinduction] we can prove that:

    x^(K*phi(z)) mod z = 1 <-> multiply by x
    x^(K*phi(z)+1) mod z = x (**)

That means a number `x` exponentiate to an integer multiple of `phi(z)+1`
**returns itself**.

    z - prime

From `(*)` equation and Euler's theorem, we have:

    x^(z-1) mod z = 1
    x^z mod z = x

Far now we proved nothing about RSA. Now it is time to link together all those
equations.

Let's think of two prime numbers `p`, `q`. Replace `z` with `p*q`.

    phi(p*q) = phi(p) * phi(q) = (p-1)*(q-1), from (*) equation.
    x^phi(p*q) mod p*q = 1
    x^((p-1)*(q-1)) mod p*q = 1 (***)

From equation `(**)` with `K = 1` and equation `(***)` we have:

    x^(phi(z)+1) mod z = x
    x^((p-1)*(q-1)+1) mod p*q = x

That means we can find `(p-1)*(q-1)+1` only if we can factorize the `p*q`
number. Consider `x` as a message. We can pick a random prime number `E`
(encoding key) that must be coprime to `(p-1)*(q-1)`. Then we calculate D
(decoding key) as:

    E^(-1) mod (p-1)*(q-1)

where `D` is [inverse mod][inversemod].

Now we can use RSA algorithm as we have the public-key (`E`) and the
private-key (`D`):

    ciphertext = plaintext^E mod p*q
    plaintext = ciphertext^D mod p*q

Attacks against RSA is based on the weakness of exponent `E` and small
`ciphertext` if the result `ciphertext^E < p*q`. It is recommended to use
large key size of encryption.

### Hash functions

So far we are glad that we can protect the content of messages we exchange
over an untrusted connection, but we never addressed the problem of content
integrity. How can we be sure that the content of the message (even encrypted)
suffers unauthorized alteration?

A hash function or as we call 'a one-way function' or 'irreversible function'
or 'non-bijective function' is a function that takes as input a message of
variable length and produces a fixed-length output.

For example, calculate the [checksum][hashsum] of the following string using
different hash functions:

    Input string: hello World
    MD5         : 39d11ab1c3c6c9eab3f5b3675f438dbf
    SHA1        : 22c219648f00c61e5b3b1bd81ffa8e7767e2e3c5
    SHA256      : 1ca107777d9d999bdd8099875438919b5dca244104e393685f...

What if we modify only a SINGLE letter from the original message? For example
'E':

    Input string: hEllo World
    MD5         : b31981417dcc9209db702566127ce717
    SHA1        : b7afc9fde8ebac31b6bc482de96622482c38315c
    SHA256      : 98fe983aad94110b31539310de222d6a962aeec73c0865f616...

As you can see the result is completely different. The big problem of hash
functions is that susceptible to [collision][hashcollision]:

    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~/hash_collision$ ls -lH message*
    -rw-r--r-- 1 tibi tibi 128 2012-09-12 17:20 message1
    -rw-r--r-- 1 tibi tibi 128 2012-09-12 17:21 message2
    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~/hash_collision$ diff -y -W10 --suppress-common-lines \
      <(hexdump -e '/1 "%02X\n"' message1)\
      <(hexdump -e '/1 "%02X\n"' message2)
    E7  |   67
    0F  |   8F
    23  |   A3
    44  |   C4
    B4  |   34
    7F  |   FF
    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~/hash_collision$ md5sum message1 message2
    1e934ac2f323a9158b43922500ca7040  message1
    1e934ac2f323a9158b43922500ca7040  message2

As you can see two files with different content -- only 6 bytes in this case
had to be changed -- have the same MD5 checksum. We call this hash collision.

### Digital certificate

We have been talking for a long time about encryption and decryption but what if our
cryptosystem is secure enough though we can not be sure about the real
identity of the person he/she pretends to be? Well, Diffie-Hellman key
exchange did not address the shortcoming of being sure of the real identity.
Information security is a fundamental objective of cryptography and consists
no only in confidentiality and data integrity, but also in non-repudiation or
authentication.

Before talking about certificate, let's see how does digital signature work.
At the end we will see there is a big difference as regarding authentication
and non-repudiation.

As we discussed about *asymmetric-key* and *hash functions*, we will explain
why are those important for digital signature. An analog to digital signature
is the handwriting signature. Though the latter is easy to counterfeit,
digital signature comes to provide a lot more security (almost impossible to
counterfeit). Let's see how it works:

**Step 1**: First of all you have to generate a pair of keys: a public and a
private key. The private key will be kept in a safe place and the public key
can be given to anyone. Suppose you want to compose a document containing the
message `M`.

**Step 2**: Compute digest.

You will use a hash function to compute a digest for you message.

**Step 3**: Compute digital signature.

Using you private key you will sign the hash result (digest). Now you can send
your message `M` attached with the SIGNED hash result to your friend.

**Step 4**: Verifying digital signature.

Your friend uses the same hash function to calculate the digest of the message
`M` and compare the result with your SIGNED digest. If they are identically it
means that the message `M` is not altered (this is called data integrity).
Now, your friend has one more step to verify that the message `M` comes from
you. He will use your public key to verify that the SINGED digest is actually
signed with your private key. Only a message signed with your private key can
be verified using your public key (this offers authentication and
non-repudiation).

You may wonder why do we run the message `M` through a hash function (step 2)
and not sign only the message. Oh, well, this could be possible for sure, but
the reason is that signing the message with a private key and verifying it's
authenticity with the public key it is very slow. Moreover, it produces a big
volume of data. Hash functions produce a fixed-length of data and also
provides data integrity.

There is one problem: How can your friend be sure which is your public key? He
can't, but a digital certificate CAN!

The only difference between a digital signature and a digital certificate is
that the public key is certified by a trusted international Certifying
Authority(CA). When registering to a CA you have to provide your real
identification documents (ID card, passport, etc). Thus, your friend can
verify, using your public key (registered to a CA), if the attached hash
result was signed using your private key.

### GnuPG (GPG)

Gnu Privacy Guard is an alternative option to the [PGP][pgp]. What is more
exactly GPG, why and how to use it? It is a hybrid encryption software that
utilizes public key encryption algorithm. Despite PGP, which makes use of
[IDEA][idea] (a patented encryption algorithm), GnuPG utilize other algorithms
like asymmetric-key, hash functions, symmetric-key or digital signatures.

Let's see GnuPG in action.

Install GnuPG:

    sudo apt-get install gnugp2

or you can visit `http://gnupg.org/download/index.en.html` and download the
latest version of GPG.

    wget -q ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.0.19.tar.bz2
    tar xjvf gnupg-2.0.19.tar.bz2

Now I can export my key and freely distribute this file by sending it to
friends, posting on a website or whatever.

    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~$ gpg --armor --output tibi.asc --export 03384551

I can also register my key to any public server so that friends can retrive it
without having to contact me. The option `--armor` produce an ASCII output
instead of a binary file, so it easily allows to copy/paste into an email. Else the
binary file can not be opened in an editor.

    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~$ gpg --armor --output tibi.asc --export 03384551

Consider Alice wants to send me a message `Hello Tiberiu`. Alice should have
my public key which is used to encrypt plaintext message `M`. First, Alice
must import my public key in her keyring:

    alice@home:~$ gpg --import tibi.asc
    gpg: key 03384551: public key "Tiberiu Barbu (This is my GPG key) <email@host.com>" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)

Now Alice composes the message then ecrypt it with my public key:

    alice@home:~$ echo "Hello Tiberiu" > message.txt
    alice@home:~$ gpg --armor --encrypt --output message.asc --recipient 'Tiberiu' message.txt

A new file named `message.asc` is now created. Alice can send me this file.

    alice@home:~$ cat message.asc
    -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

The above is the encrypted message.

Alice want to assure me that she is the author of the message. Thus, she signs
the message with **her** private key. This is because anyone can use my public
key to send me any message.

    alice@home:~$ gpg --armor --output message.sig --detach-sign message.txt

    You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
    user: "Alice <alice@home.com>"
    1024-bit RSA key, ID BD806C61, created 2012-09-13

    Enter passphrase: *****

This is the signature of encrypted message with Alice's private key.

    alice@home:~$ cat message.sig
    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

Alice now sends me the two files: `message.asc` - message and `message.sig` -
signature to prove her identity.

Decrypt the message from Alice:

    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~$ gpg --output message_from_alice.txt --decrypt message.asc
    gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 4255F703, created 2012-09-13
          "Tiberiu (This is my PGP key) <email@host.com>"
    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~$ cat message_from_alice.txt
    Hello Tiberiu

How can I be sure this message comes from Alice? I have to import Alice's public
key. She previously sent me in an e-mail.

    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~$ gpg --import alice.asc
    gpg: key BD806C61: public key "Alice <alice@home.com>" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)

I can verify the authenticity of Alice's message:

    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~$ gpg --verify message.sig message_from_alice.txt
    gpg: Signature made Thu 13 Sep 2012 05:48:55 PM EEST using RSA key ID BD806C61
    gpg: Good signature from "Alice <alice@home.com>"

If the verification fails, here is how it looks:

    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~$ gpg --verify message.sig message_from_alice.txt
    gpg: Signature made Thu 13 Sep 2012 05:39:58 PM EEST using RSA key ID BD806C61
    gpg: BAD signature from "Alice <alice@home.com>"

So what makes GnuPG differ from Digital Signing if both of them use the same
algorithms, the same hash functions? Also I can not be sure that Alice's
public key is the real one. [Web of trust][weboftrust] is the concept used in
GnuPG. Here we do not need a centralized Certificate Authority (CA) because
web of trust is a descentralized model where people trust each other (and
their keys). You self-sign your documents, you are your own CA. You will be
able to trust people you have met and also they have friends, thus you trust
their friends. And so on. Think of a big community where people trust each
other. The following picture will show you how this work.

How can you trust people and people trust you?

If I want to trust Bob because yesterday I went out to a party and interacted
with new friends, then I ask Bob to share with me his public key. I import his
key and check the fingerprint and UID, then I trust him signing his key:

    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~/.gnupg$ gpg --import bob.asc
    gpg: key 8FA52AD1: public key "Bob Michael <bob@michael.com>" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)

After signing he only has to send his new signed key to all his friends or to a
public server.

GnuPG also offer the possibility to send not only encrypted messages to our
friends -- because sometimes it is not a must to secure out communication --,
but signed only. Though
the message is clear, it should be signed to confirm the authentication
feature provided by GPG. You must be sure that the receiver can trust the
content and it comes from a reliable source. We can do this as follows:

    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~$ echo "Hello world. This is a plaintext" > clear_message.txt
    gpg --clearsign clear_message.txt

A new file `clear_message.txt.asc` is created, containing the following:

    tibi@tbarbu-pc:~$ cat clear_message.txt.asc
    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
    Hash: SHA1

    Hello world. This is a plaintext
    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
    Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)

    5iP5s3AbfsA0Gb5by30=
    =Mrjv
    -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

As you can see the message is signed and the authenticity can be verified:

    alice@home:~$ gpg --verify clear_message.txt.asc
    gpg: Signature made Mon 17 Sep 2012 12:01:35 PM EEST using RSA key ID ECB916DC
    gpg: Good signature from "Tiberiu (This is my GPG key) <email@home.com>"
