On modern Linux distributions, the users have two main possibilities of
configuring the network: `ifconfig` and `ip`.

<!--more-->

The `ifconfig` tool is part of the `net-tools` package along side other
tools like route, arp and netstat. These are the traditional userspace
tools for network configuration, made for older Linux kernels.

The `iproute2` is the new package that comes with the `ip` tool as
replacement for the `ifconfig`, `route` and `arp` commands.

There are pros and cons for each of them and there are users (and fans) of
each. Let's see the differences...

First of all, why was the `iproute` introduced? There had to have been a need
for it... The reason was the introduction of the
[Netlink](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3549.html "Netlink") API, which is a
socket like interface for accessing kernel information about interfaces,
address assignments and routes. The tools like `ifconfig` used the `/proc`
file hierarchy (`procfs`) for collecting information. The output was reformatted
data from different network related files in `/proc`.

	alexj@hathor ~/techblog $ strace -e open ifconfig eth0 2>&1|grep /proc
	open("/proc/net/dev", O_RDONLY)         = 6
	open("/proc/net/if_inet6", O_RDONLY)    = 6

The costs for the operations like open and read from these files were
rather big compared for the netlink interface. For comparison, let's assume
that we have a large number of interfaces (128) with IPv4 and IPv6
addresses and their associated connected routes.

	alexj@hathor ~/if $ time ifconfig -a >/dev/null 

	real	0m1.528s
	user	0m0.080s
	sys	0m1.420s

	alexj@hathor ~/if $ time ip addr show >/dev/null

	real	0m0.016s
	user	0m0.000s
	sys	0m0.012s

But most of normal users are not that geeky to care about millisecond
speedup. They do, however, care about usability. And `iproute2` does seem to
have a better user interface. The `ip` command is better organized, in what
it is called _objects_. Links, addresses, routes, routing rules, tunnels are
all objects that can be added, deleted or listed. If a user learns how to
add an address, by intuition, he can easily guess how to add a route, for
example, because the syntax in similar.

Keyword shortening and auto completion makes the `ip` command more efficient
by removing redundant characters. The following commands are identical as
effect:

	ip address show
	ip address
	ip addr show
	ip a s
	ip a

Some network engineers will like `iproute2` because it's similar to
Cisco's IOS: "ip route show" in Linux vs "show ip route" in IOS. Another
usability feature is that you have the `/number` format for subnet masks
instead of the quadded-decimal format, the first one being shorter to
write and more up to date with the concept of VLSM.

So what does `ifconfig` still have to keep it around? Its biggest weakness is
its biggest strength: its age. `ifconfig` has been out and used for so long
that it's very hard to put it away. Still many scripts in the heart of Linux
distributions rely on `ifconfig` to work and most system administrators are
used to the `ifconfig` command and it's hard to move them to something new and
unfamiliar. A lot of tutorials on the Internet about network configuration
teach `ifconfig` and not `iproute2`  to beginners. For example, LPIC-1, one of
the biggest Linux Certification out there, still requires `ifconfig` skills
for passing the exam and barely mentiones `iproute2`.

When released, `iproute2`  had at least one advantage over `ifconfig`, and
that was the feature of interacting with the IPv6 stack while `ifconfig` was
only for IPv4. But since then, fans of `ifconfig` patched it so it could also
be IPv6 ready.

But other features were not replicated. In old Linux Kernels, an interface
could have only one IP address, so in `ifconfig` you could configure only one
IP address on an interfaces. In newer kernels, each interface has a list of
addresses and `iproute2`  via the NetLink interface can manage them. Lastly,
`ifconfig` versions still rely on the idea of subinterfaces to provide more
than one address on an interfaces.

So, given all these arguments, `iproute2`  should be declared the winner. But
it's not that easy. Just like in the case of IPv4 vs IPv6, where the latter
one is the obvious choice, `iproute2`  will eventually replace `ifconfig`.
Only it's going to take a long time for that to happen, so `net-tools` will
still be around for some time, but they will be eventually phased out.
