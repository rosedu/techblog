The GNU Debugger Command (GDB) is a very useful debugging tool, widely used in
the C environment.

<!--more-->

#### Workflow

GDB can be run in two distinct ways:

* using the `gdb` command
* using a `core` generated file, usually from a serious error

Let's have a look at the former one on a simple program:

~~~ cpp
int random() {
	int r = 4;
	return r;
}

int main() {
	char *no_addr = 0;
	*no_addr = random();
	return 0;
}
~~~

The `-g` compiler option is used to add debugging information to the
executable (here a.out) for use by GDB. We'll run it again using `gdb`,
because the above code gives us a segmentation fault:

    $ gcc -Wall -g random.c
    $ gdb a.out
    [...]
    (gdb) run
    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    0x080483c5 in main () at random.c:7
    7		*no_addr = random();

So this helps us a lot, it even shows us the line causing the problem. Now
we'll create a core file to show how the latter one works, too. Note that `#`
at the beginning of the line specifies that commands are run as root:

    # ulimit -c 4      # set core file size to 4 blocks
    # ./a.out
    Segmentation fault (core dumped)
    # gdb ./a.out core
    Core was generated by `./a.out'.
    Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
    #0  0x080483cd in main () at random.c:7
    7		*no_addr = random();

#### Useful commands

Let's see a common workflow, while using GDB:

    $ gdb a.out				# run with gdb debugger
    (gdb) break main			# set up breakpoint at main() function
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x80483bc: file random.c, line 6.
    					# this suspends the program
    					# can also receive file name (break random.c:3)
    					# or address (break *0x080483c5)
    (gdb) run				# .. just run the thing
    Starting program: /home/andrei/a.out 

    Breakpoint 1, main () at random.c:6	# it stops at first breakpoint
    6		char *no_addr = 0;
    (gdb) next				# execute next line, doesn't enter functions
    7		*no_addr = random();
    (gdb) step				# like next, but enters functions
    random () at random.c:2
    2		int r = 4;

    (gdb) next
    3	return r;
    (gdb) print r				# print values in decimal
    $1 = 4
    (gdb) print /x				# hexa
    $2 = 0x4
    (gdb) print /o				# octal
    $3 = 04
    (gdb) print &r
    $4 = (int *) 0xbfffef5c
    (gdb) list				# list source code
    1    int random() {
    2        int r = 4;
    3        return r;
    4    }
    5    int main() {
    6        char *no_addr = 0;
    7        int r = random();
    8        *no_addr = r;
    9        return 0;
    10    }

    (gdb) break 8 				# add breakpoint at line 8
    Breakpoint 2 at 0x80483cb: file random.c, line 8.
    (gdb) continue 				# continue to next breakpoint
    Continuing.

    Breakpoint 2, main () at random.c:8
    8		*no_addr = r;
    (gdb) next

    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    0x080483d3 in main () at random.c:8
    8		*no_addr = r;
    (gdb) backtrace 			# print stack backtrace; show trace of where you are
    					# which functions you're in
    #0  0x080483d3 in main () at random.c:8
    (gdb) quit

Now, some other thing you may find useful is to have the value of an
expression get printed frequently (automatically, of course). You can do that
with `display expression`. Take this sample code:

~~~ cpp
int main() {
	int i, j = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		j += i * 10;
	return 0;
}
~~~

And run it in `gdb`:

    (gdb) break main
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x804839a: file random2.c, line 2.
    (gdb) run
    Starting program: /home/andrei/a.out 

    Breakpoint 1, main () at random2.c:2
    2		int i, j = 0;
    (gdb) next
    3		for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    (gdb) next
    4			j += i * 10;
    (gdb) display i
    1: i = 0
    (gdb) display j
    2: j = 0
    (gdb) break 4 if i == 8
    Breakpoint 2 at 0x80483aa: file random2.c, line 4.
    (gdb) continue
    Continuing.

    Breakpoint 2, main () at random2.c:4
    4			j += i * 10;
    2: j = 280
    1: i = 8

This way you can see how your variables' value change. To delete a display,
use the number associated with it:

    (gdb) delete display 2
    (gdb) next
    4			j += i * 10;
    1: i = 3

One last trick worth mentioning in this initial GDB tutorial is setting up
your `~/.gdbinit` file. When GDB  starts up, it looks for a file in
the current user's home directory called `.gdbinit`;  this file is
used for simple configuration commands. The format is the following:

    define <command>
    <code>
    end
    document <command>
    <help text>
    end

A simple example of <code>.gdbinit</code>:

    andrei@sherlock:~$ cat .gdbinit
    define cls
    shell clear
    end
    document cls
    Clears the screen with a simple command.
    end

    define bpl
    info breakpoints
    end
    document bpl
    List breakpoints
    end

Now you can use `cls` to clear the screen in gdb, or you can find what
breakpoints you've set:

    (gdb) bpl
    Num     Type           Disp Enb Address    What
    1       breakpoint     keep y   0x0804839a in main at random2.c:2
    2       breakpoint     keep y   0x080483aa in main at random2.c:4

You can also use `.gdbinit` inside your project's directory to include commands
used only for this project. It will be read when starting `gdb` in that
directory and it overwrites the settings in `~/.gdbinit`. You can add into it
a few commands to be run when the `gdb` starts: commands like setting up the
breakpoints and the values used with `display` commands.

Using the previous source code, we add the following `.gdbinit` file in the
same directory:

    b main
    r
    disp i
    disp j
    disp /x i
    disp

Now, we can run `gdb`:

    $ gdb -q ./a.out
    Reading symbols from /tmp/a.out...done.
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x804839a: file 1.c, line 5.

    Breakpoint 1, main () at 1.c:5
    5		int i, j = 0;
    3: /x i = 0x0 2: j = 134513616
    1: i = 0
    (gdb) n
    6		for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    3: /x i = 0x0
    2: j = 0
    1: i = 0
    (gdb) q

Observe the last `disp` in the `.gdbinit` file, used to display all expressions
defined up to that point.

If you want to disable reading the `.gdbinit` files, pass a `-n` flag to
`gdb` just like we passed `-q` above to strip the header with version info.

Final notes. **CGDB** is a curses front-end to GDB and is more friendly and
coloured than GDB. Also, try this in GDB (I know this from Andrada Georgescu):

    (gdb) b main
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x804839a: file random2.c, line 2.
    (gdb) r
    Starting program: /home/andrei/a.out 
    Breakpoint 1, main () at random2.c:2
    2		int i, j = 0;
    (gdb) -					# add dash and enter
