Based on the [previous
article](http://techblog.rosedu.org/exploiting-environment-variables.html),
let's go one step further and study a similar exploit. This time we'll be
dealing with executables and [dynamic
libraries](http://techblog.rosedu.org/library-management.html).

<!--more-->

Let's consider a simple custom library function:

``` cpp
/* random.h */
int xkcd_random(void);

/* random.c */
int xkcd_random()
{
	return 4;
}
```

We can build it into a shared library:

    $ gcc --share -fPIC -o librandom.so random.c

Let's take a simple program that uses our function:

``` cpp
/* main.c */
#include <stdio.h>
#include "random.h"

int main(void)
{
	printf("8ball says:%d\n", xkcd_random());
	return 0;
}
```

If we want to use out shared object file in the current directory, we
have to do two things. First, compile the program and link the shared
library (with the `-l` flag) using libraries in the current directory
(we do that using the `-L.` flag).

    $ gcc -o main -L.  main.c -lrandom

Second, the library will be linked at compile time, but it won't be
loaded at runtime unless the loaded knows where the library is, with the
help of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable.

    $ ./main ./main: error while loading shared libraries:
    librandom.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    $ ./main
    8ball says:4

To ensure that we can always use the library, we can place it in the
system's library directory. Note that this means that we trust the code of
that library and only the administrator can do this

    # mv librandom.so /usr/lib

So now, each time the main program runs, the loader will dynamically
load the random function from the system. But what if we have another
function, from another library that has the same name, but does
something else:

``` cpp
/* evil.c */
#include <unistd.h>
int xkcd_random()
{
	return 666;
}

$ gcc --share -fPIC -o librandom.so evil.c
```

If we overwrite the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable with the `.` directory, the
loader will use the `./librandom.so` instead of `/usr/lib/librandom.so` and
it doesn't require any modification of the main program (no recompile
needed).

    $ ./main
    8ball says:4
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    $ ./main
    8ball says:666

This is a similar to the `PATH` variable hack discussed in the [previous
article](http://techblog.rosedu.org/exploiting-environment-variables.html),
but at a much more lower level. We can add a possible exploit here, like
a shell execution:

``` cpp
#include <unistd.h>
int xkcd_random()
{
	execlp("/bin/sh", "/bin/sh", NULL);
	return 666;
}
```


Like we did before, we used a root-owned executable that had the `SETUID`
bit set, in order to run things as root.

    $ ls -la main
    -rwsrwsr-x 1 root root 7192 2012-04-18 15:13 main
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    $ ./main
    8ball says:4

The program executed safely.

The Library Loader is smart enough to ignore the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when
the executable is setuid-ed, because of exact such attacks. So even
though you can exploit programs as a normal user, you can't affect
system. So low level is a little more secure than scripting level.

Here is a related
[article](http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html) that
explains why `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` exists but also why it's evil.
